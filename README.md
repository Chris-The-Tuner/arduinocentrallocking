# Arduino (Nano) Central-Locking
An arduino (nano) based central locking system


# What it does
Basicly its just switching some outputs when an input is comming in (toggle).

On default the script is in state "doors open".
If you give the Arduino a HIGH input on Digital Pin 2 (default) it will start to close the doors, honk for a small moment and tuning on the warning lights for a short amount of time.
Give it an input again and it will start to open the doors and do the rest as before.

# Why does it exist ?
To be honest, i wanted to build a system like this for a good friend.
Normally there is no need for an arduino in this project, but i have quite a few arduino nano's laying around....
The cost of NE555 Timers and the needed components would be more than just using an arduino nano.
Also the arduino can be further expanded, possible to control even more stuff (who knows what the future brings)

# It's not working correctly, can you help me ?
SURE ! Contact me via E-Mail to christhetuner1993@googlemail.com !
I reply ASAP ;)

# How is the circuit build ?
I will update this here when i have a ready made circuit, be paitent for some days :*
